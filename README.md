# Covid 19 Data Analysis
*Project Overview:* This project involves an in-depth analysis of global COVID-19 data spanning 2 years and 195 countries. Using SQL queries, I extracted insights and trends from the dataset, shedding light on the pandemic's impact and response efficiency across different nations.

*Key Objectives:*
1. Explore global COVID-19 data to identify trends and correlations.
2. Develop country-level KPIs to measure pandemic response efficiency.
3. Analyze vaccination, infection, and mortality rates across different countries.

*Methodology:* SQL queries were used to extract, transform, and analyze the dataset. Various data visualization techniques were employed to communicate findings effectively.

*Outcomes:* The project yielded valuable insights into global COVID-19 trends, country-level response efficiency, and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts. The findings of this project can inform policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers in their efforts to combat futureÂ pandemics.
